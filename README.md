A passionate frontend developer from Nigeria,and also beginner

## Overview
- Iâ€™m currently learning Html and CSS

### The challenge
the challenge for me as a beginner is that to build out this data storage component and get it looking as close to the design as possible took my energy.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size


## My process

### Built this project with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.
